# Drowsiness-Detection
Developed a system to detect drowsiness in real-time using Computer Vision. Works on the Euclidean Algorithm which calculates Eye-Aspect-Ratio of the person and then classifies the result as being drowsy using the Machine Learning Algorithm - Haar cascade Classifier.  After the detection, an alarm rings alongwith an alert notification displayed on the screen.
